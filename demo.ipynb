       " 'metadatas': [[{'text': 'By Kate RaviliousScience writer Chile\\'s earthquake barely made the news, whilst Nepal\\'s has brought complete and utter devastation. How did two such similar earthquakes have such disparate effects? A huge part of the answer is, of course, building standards and wealth. Since Chile\\'s terrible M9.5 earthquake in 1960, where over 5,500 people died, the country has taken big steps in modernising its buildings, designing them to withstand the shaking produced by great earthquakes. Meanwhile, in Nepal, few buildings were up to code, and many toppled when the earthquake struck. But wealth and building codes don\\'t tell the entire story: the geology is different, too. Nepal sits on a continental collision zone (India is smashing into Asia) and its earthquake fault is well disguised: most of the fault is buried deep underground and surface ruptures are quickly covered by muds washed down by monsoon rains and the dense jungle. Furthermore, the speed of this continental collision (around 4.5cm every year) means that major quakes only hit Nepal every few decades. Chile\\'s fault meanwhile is obvious - a whopping great trench where the Pacific Ocean floor dives underneath South America at a rate of nearly 10cm per year - with major earthquakes occurring every year, making earthquake-resilience a priority. As continental collision zones go, Nepal\\'s is at the simpler end of the spectrum and has been relatively well studied. Indeed, geologists had identified Nepal\\'s most vulnerable segment of fault just weeks before the recent deadly quake struck. Other countries in continental collision zones are underlain by a nightmare of widely dispersed faults, splintering across thousands of kilometres of land. All the way from the Mediterranean to Indonesia, lies a restless network of earthquake faults, created by the African, Arabian and Indian plates forging northwards into the Eurasian plate. Massive cities - including Istanbul, Tehran, Tabriz and Ashkhabad - are situated on some of the most dangerous land on Earth. \"Because continental faults are less confined, they rupture less frequently, with some faults only coming to life every few thousand years - well beyond human memory or recorded history,\" explains James Jackson, a geologist at Cambridge University, UK, who heads up Earthquakes Without Frontiers, a project to increase resilience to continental earthquakes. Since 1900, earthquakes on continental faults have killed twice as many people as earthquakes on ocean-continent boundaries. Over the last few years, Jackson and his colleagues have been tracking down these elusive continental faults in Iran, Kazakhstan and China. Using high-resolution satellite images, they can spot anomalies in the landscape that hint at where the fault may lie. Meanwhile, seismic reflections help to draw a picture of what lies underground. And back in the lab, the scientists study regular satellite snapshots of the Earth\\'s surface to monitor how the planet\\'s surface is deforming. \"We can see exactly where the Earth is being stretched apart or sheared, enabling us to map which parts of the Earth are under greatest strain,\" says Richard Walters from Leeds University, a member of the Earthquakes Without Frontiers team. Inverted expenditure In Nepal\\'s case, much of this information was already available, and indeed a great deal of work had been done by local organisations (such as the National Society for Earthquake Technology) to prepare for the next big earthquake - training stonemasons, retrofitting schools and hospitals, educating people about earthquakes and stockpiling vital resources. \"It does appear that there has been much less loss of life than would have been expected from such a large earthquake (though the toll could still turn out to be in the tens of thousands) and there is evidence that the programmes of the Nepalese government and some of the non-profit agencies did save lives,\" says Philip England, a geologist at Oxford University, also part of the Earthquakes without Frontiers team. If nothing else the devastating earthquake in Nepal will hopefully highlight to the international community how vital it is to build earthquake resilience. \"Five times more money is spent on a response [to an earthquake] than it is on helping people to prepare,\" Katie Peters, from the Overseas Development Institute in London, told Sky News earlier this week. The first results from the EU\\'s Sentinal 1 satellite show that last Saturday\\'s earthquake in Nepal did not rupture the surface, suggesting that significant strain may still be stored on that segment of the fault, and that another large earthquake could hit in the coming decades. \"Appalling though this event is, it could have been far, far worse. Let\\'s hope that this event is the trigger for a more positive outcome next time,\" says England.',\n",

       "   {'text': 'By Danielle HaydenBBC News \"Herefordshire experiences a lot of earthquakes compared to other areas,\" says David Galloway, seismologist at the British Geological Survey (BGS). More than 100 have been recorded in the county in the last 40 years - and five small tremors have happened already this year, he says. Hereford was named twice in the BGS list of the most significant British earthquakes - with magnitudes of 5.2 in 1863 and 5.3 in 1896. The largest-known earthquake in the UK had a magnitude of 6.1 and happened in the North Sea on 7 June 1931. Although the majority of earthquakes go unobserved by those not in the know, one or two a month are felt and can cause alarm. Mr Galloway says the most recent \"widely felt\" tremor, in Bromyard in 2008, had a magnitude of 3.6 and affected areas between Malvern and Worcester. He says people described the quake as feeling like \"a lorry crashing in to the side of their house\" and more than a dozen people contacted the police. One Malvern resident told the Telegraph: \"I saw the wardrobe doors rattle and thought someone was trapped in it. It was terrifying.\" \"There has been a number of earthquakes in Herefordshire, some only detected by our BGS seismometers but some larger ones which were widely felt all over the region,\" Mr Galloway says. \"And also bear in mind that some other earthquakes have occurred out of the region but were felt in Herefordshire, for example the magnitude 5.1 Shropshire earthquake on 2 April 1990.\" Since 1975, 108 earthquakes have been recorded in Herefordshire, but barely any hit headlines. This is because they register as low on the seismograph, which measures the magnitude of the earthquake, from 1 for small to 10 for super intense. This information is gathered from a network of more than 100 seismograph stations across the UK with the closest being in Michaelchurch, Herefordshire. \"We don\\'t really know why so we record so many here, as earthquakes in the UK are random,\" says Mr Galloway. \"The country is in the middle of [the Eurasian] plate, which is moving all the time, so it sometimes stresses certain areas. \"But it does seem that places such as Herefordshire, Wales and North West Scotland are areas particularly prone to them.\" This story was inspired by Your Questions: \"Has there ever been an earthquake in Hereford?\"',\n",

       "   {'text': 'By Kate RaviliousScience writer This latest quake follows the same pattern as a duo of big tremors that occurred over 700 years ago, and results from a domino effect of strain transferring along the fault, geologists say. The researchers discovered the likely existence of this doublet effect only in recent weeks, during field work in the region. Saturday\\'s quake, which struck an area in central Nepal, between the capital Kathmandu and the city of Pokhara, has had a far-reaching impact. More than 4,000 people have lost their lives, with victims in Bangladesh, India, Tibet, and on Mount Everest, where avalanches were triggered. Death tolls and casualty figures are likely to rise over the coming days, and the risk of landslides on slopes made unstable by the quake mean that the danger is far from passed. Trench investigations In a sadly prescient turn of events, Laurent Bollinger, from the CEA research agency in France, and his colleagues, uncovered the historical pattern of earthquakes during fieldwork in Nepal last month, and anticipated a major earthquake in exactly the location where Saturday\\'s big tremor has taken place. Down in the jungle in central southern Nepal, Bollinger\\'s team dug trenches across the country\\'s main earthquake fault (which runs for more than 1,000km from west to east), at the place where the fault meets the surface, and used fragments of charcoal buried within the fault to carbon-date when the fault had last moved. Ancient texts mention a number of major earthquakes, but locating them on the ground is notoriously difficult. Monsoon rains wash soils down the hillsides and dense jungle covers much of the land, quickly obscuring earthquake ruptures. Bollinger\\'s group was able to show that this segment of fault had not moved for a long time. \"We showed that this fault was not responsible for the great earthquakes of 1505 and 1833, and that the last time it moved was most likely 1344,\" says Bollinger, who presented his findings to the Nepal Geological Society two weeks ago. Previously, the team had worked on the neighbouring segment of fault, which lies to the east of Kathmandu, and had shown that this segment experienced major quakes in 1255, and then more recently in 1934. The deadly pattern of quakes around Kathmandu When Bollinger and his colleagues saw this historic pattern of events, they became greatly concerned. \"We could see that both Kathmandu and Pokhara would now be particularly exposed to earthquakes rupturing the main fault, where it likely last did in 1344, between the two cities,\" explains Paul Tapponnier, from the Earth Observatory of Singapore, who was working with Bollinger. When a large earthquake occurs, it is common for the movement to transfer strain further along the earthquake fault, and this seems to be what happened in 1255. Over the following 89 years, strain accumulated in the neighbouring westerly segment of fault, finally rupturing in 1344. Now, history has repeated itself, with the 1934 fault transferring strain westwards along the fault, which has finally been released today, 81 years later. And, worryingly, the team warns there could be more to come. \"Early calculations suggest that Saturday\\'s magnitude-7.8 earthquake is probably not big enough to rupture all the way to the surface, so there is still likely to be more strain stored, and we should probably expect another big earthquake to the west and south of this one in the coming decades,\" says Bollinger.
