      "This was a gift for my son and daughter-in-law. We played it while they were visiting and had a good time. It is not difficult to learn, but it can be challenging to outwit the other players. I would recommend this game.<separator>Got this as a present for my husband and he is in love with the game.. It requires a mix of strategy and luck.. A bit difficult to understand at first but once you start playing it becomes super easy. Played with my 12 year old brother who also loves the game.<separator>Got this game for the family and everyone loves it.  From kids to grand parents, it is easy to understand, fund to play and requires some stratigic thinking.<separator>The game is kinda easy but yet interesting. Good time spent with the family - we played it several times in 2 weeks and it has not annoyed us yet.<separator>This has been a fun game to play. It is a little complicated when you first start out, and generally takes at least half a game for people to actually understand how to play. Use the first game as a throw away game, and don't try to explain everything at the beginning or you will get overwhelmed.<separator>Game arrived with all the pieces intact and in good shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game itself is a favorite for friends and family that a variety of board games. It's easy enough to understand yet retains a measurable amount of strategy and skill for those who like more of a challenge.<separator>I purchased this as a gift.  This game takes a bit of practice to understand but is fun.  Very fair price too!<separator>I am in love this game!\n",
      "If you are buying this for kids then, I don't think they'll able to understand it very quickly or efficiently. You may have to change the rules to make it easier. But if it is for a couple or to play with you group of friends, trust me and buy this one! Yeah it's a little cosly when compared to few other board games but I thinks it's worth it. It is so much fun!<separator>The first time we played it, it was a little confusing, but the second round was much easier. Had a lot of fun and the board is well made as well as the pieces. I would recommend this game to anyone.<separator>It was an easy game to learn and was very enjoyable to play. I gave it to my sister as a gift and she was thrilled with this game. Just the right amount of strategy and luck to keep your interest. I highly recommend this game it's fun.<separator>A very easy game to learn and play. Lots of replay value since every game you play is different. Great game to learn basic strategy and enjoy the time together with family and friends.<separator>Seems overwhelming at first, but very easy to play once you get started. The game doesn't rely on conversation so I can play with friends even if they don't speak a common language.<separator>This is a really fun game. The instructions are pretty straight forward. The game offers good strategy thinking for the whole family.  A simple game that can be played multiple times. The game doesn't take long to understand.  My family had a lot of fun playing this game. We enjoyed trying to out play the other.<separator>There's a bit of a learning curve.  The instructions could be a little bit clearer.  But halfway through the first game, we were hooked!  Lots of fun.<separator>This game is very entertaining plus strategic. Everyone enjoyed playing the game, but make sure that if you have young children you keep the game pieces away from them--there are many small items that a small child could put in their mouth and swallow. The directions were not difficult to understand. We bought the game after playing it at a friend's house and have had a good time playing it as a family and with friends.<separator>Great game, it's not complicated at all very easy and quick to learn but yet still fun to play.<separator>I love this game!  Me, family and friends play it all the time and it never gets old.  It is easy to understand and there are enough variations that it is never the same game twice.<separator>Great game. Requires skill but not too complicated. My family loves the game. Easy to follow instructions.<separator>I was already very familiar with this game, but it still fabulous! Bought this one especially to teach my 5yo twins how to play. They need a little help still, but are able to grasp the basic concept.<separator>I bought this after watching a YouTube video showing how it is played. This is by far our favorite new family game. My older children (ages 10 & 8) have no issues understanding how to play, and have picked up on strategy after playing just a few times.  Less complicated than Risk and more complex than Clue, which makes it perfect for our family.\n",
